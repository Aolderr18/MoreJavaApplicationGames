I invented a game where the user navigates around a two 
   dimensional grid and needs to match up similar shapes with the 
   same color. The grid is made up of square cells with walls 
   either colored blue or red. If a wall is colored red, the 
   navigator cannot go through it. If a wall is colored blue, the
   navigator can go through it. Each time the navigator enters a 
   new cell the colors of walls of the cell entered change colors
   based on what direction the navigator came from. There are two
   grids. Each grid starts out with 4 white dots. If the 
   navigator is in the same cell as a white dot, the white dot 
   changes into either a purple or yellow square or triangle. It
   changes back into a white dot after the user exits the cell.        
   The user can then choose to teleport to the other room. The     
   user must locate a matching cell. If the user matches up two    
   identical shapes with the same color and shape, each of the    
   white dots in both rooms disappear. The user wins a round if   
   all white dots are cleared. If the user has previously touched  
   a white dot in the current round and the last shape they 
   uncovered does not match this one, they lose the round.
